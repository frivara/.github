# Frivara

Frivara (Swedish for Freeware) is a community creating open source software solutions for solving every day issues. Many problems, no matter their size or severity, can be solved or mitigated by applying the right software solutions. 

We create such solutions and make them as accessible as possible for others to use and learn from. As such, any works made by the community will always be open source, and available for others to fork or make use of however they wish.
